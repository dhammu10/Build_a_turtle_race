# 🐢 Turtle Race Game

Welcome to the **Turtle Race Game** built using Python's `turtle` module! This fun and interactive project lets you bet on a turtle and watch it race against others to the finish line. Will your chosen color win?

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Run the Python script.
2. A window will open, and you'll be prompted to **bet** on a turtle by entering its color (e.g., `red`, `blue`, `green`).
3. The race begins automatically!
4. Watch the turtles race and see if your turtle wins.
